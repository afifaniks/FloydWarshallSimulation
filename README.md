**Project Components:**

- Distance Table
- Sequence Table
- Auto Play
- Graph Simulation

## CAUTION: ##

- THIS PROJECT IS DEVELOPED ON LINUX ENVIRONMENT USING NETBEANS IDE 8.2, JAVAFX
- INCLUDED JAR FILES SHOULD BE IMPORTED TO IDE(Location: /lib)
- RED COLORED EDGE SIGNIFIES BIDIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIP
- ANY OTHER COLOR SIGNIFIES THAT EDGE IS STARTING FROM THE SAME COLORED VERTEX TO THE OTHER VERTEX
  (FOR EXAMPLE: THE EDGE BETWEEN B, E INDICATES A DIRECTION FROM B **TO** E)
- BUGS COULD BE FOUND
